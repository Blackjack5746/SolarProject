          <div class="d1" class="container"> <h3> Basic Overview of the Project: </h3> <p> There is a need to generate energy 
          using renewable resources and minimize the use of fossil fuels. The biggest factor hindering the complete migration 
          or at least widespread integration of solar energy is the issue of intermittency, where there is an inconsistency 
          in the output generated by solar installations at any given moment. This makes it harder for grid operators to 
          balance the energy supply and demand curves. This has led to an increase in research on how to easily and more 
          reliably integrate renewable energy sources like solar into the grid.  </p>  
          
          <p> The principal factor determining the output, or yield, of a PV panel is the amount of solar irradiation 
          reaching the panel, which varies greatly depending on what happens in the air space between the sun and the panel. 
          The ability to precisely forecast the output of PV systems is of great importance and has been identified as one of 
          the key challenges for massive PV integration. Different strategies can be used to make predictions about solar 
          yield, like deterministic machine learning (ML), as used in this project.  </p>
          
          <p> This study aims to determine whether environmental parameters (other than solar irradiation) local to a PV
           panel, such as the temperature of the panel, air temperature, air pressure, relative humidity, IR radiation, dust 
           particles, and carbon monoxide (CO) around the panel, etc, can be used to predict the solar yield of the panel by
            using machine learning techniques and to evaluate the accuracy of those predictions. </p>
          
          <p> The gallery section of this website shows the system, made up of sensors, solar panel, and microcontroller, 
          that was built to predict the energy yield. A machine learning model is a file that has been trained to recognize 
          certain types of patterns. It uses AI to learn the trends embedded in historical data, which has been measured.
          </p>
          
          <p> The model was trained over a set of data by using a deep learning neural network with four layers and was 
          then saved and deployed in a web server where the API of the model can be used to provide it with data it has 
          not seen before, and it will be able to reason over that data and make predictions on that data. This can be 
          done on the homepage of the website by clicking “predict.” </p>
          
          <p> The project seeks to answer the following research question: To what extent can the local environmental 
          conditions of a PV panel be used to build a machine learning model that capable of predicting the solar yield 
          of the panel? </p>
          
          <p> The figure below shows a high-level visual illustration of the different aspects of the system. The system 
          is an integration of the sensor network which will be collecting local data from the PV panel, and a human 
          interacting with the system via a user interface (this website) connected to the system through the Internet 
          of Things (IoT). Within the system is be a machine learning model running in real-time, receiving data from 
          the sensors and making predictions. </p>

          <p> While the below figure shows the functional diagram for the sensing subsystem. </p>

          <p> <h5>ESP WROOM-32 </h5> Unlike a traditional Arduino board, this microcontroller comes pre-installed with a Wi-Fi 
          module and Bluetooth. The ESP, shown in figure 15, has an operating voltage of 5VDC and an operating current 
          of 80mA on average. It requires a supply that can provide a minimum current of 500mA.</p>  
          <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='ESPWROOM32.jpg')}}" align="middle" width="980" height="200" style="vertical-align:bottom" />
          
          <p> <h5> Temperature and Humidity Sensor </h5> The DHT22 is a digital sensor that is directly supported by 
          Arduino and provides very accurate results and refreshes very quickly, at a sample rate of 0.5Hz. 
          The operating voltage is 3.3-5.0VDC with a temperature range of -40°C–125°C and a humidity range of 0-100%. 
          This sensor costs around ZAR180, which is reasonable considering that it is essentially a two-in-one. </p> 
          <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='DHT22.jpg')}}" align="middle" width="980" height="200" style="vertical-align:bottom" />
          
          <p>  <h5> Pressure Sensor </h5>
          The BMP180 Digital pressure sensor is used for measuring atmospheric pressure. The sensor is good for a 
          pressure range of 300-1100hPa, requires a supply voltage between 1.8-3.6VDC. It is relatively small at 
          3.6mm x 3.8mm and super flat with two modes of operation, ultra low power mode and advanced resolution mode. 
          It costs around ZAR160.
          </p> 
          <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='BPS180.jpg')}}" align="middle" width="980" height="200" style="vertical-align:bottom" />
          
          <p>  <h5> CO Sensor </h5>
          The SNS-MQ7 carbon monoxide sensor is shown below. The sensor has an operating voltage of 5V, an operating 
          temperature -20℃-50℃ and relative humidity of less than 95%. The detecting range is 20ppm-2000ppm carbon 
          monoxide. The cost of the sensor is ZAR140.
          </p> 
          <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='SNSMQ7.jpg')}}" align="middle" width="980" height="200" style="vertical-align:bottom" />
          
          <p>  <h5> Particulate Matter Sensor </h5>
          The PM2.5 dust sensor module can detect particulate matter (dust) and only costs ZAR198.
          </p> 
          <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='PM25.jpg')}}" align="middle" width="980" height="200" style="vertical-align:bottom" />
          
          <p>  <h5> Combined voltage and current sensor </h5>
          Some sensors can perform the functions of voltage and current sensing simultaneously, like the INA219 
          sensor shown below. The INA219 module shown in figure 24 senses voltages from 0 to 26 V and has an accuracy 
          of 0.5%  over temperature. It uses the I2C communication protocol. It also has an additional multiplying 
          register that calculates power in watts. The device uses a single 3- to 5.5-V supply, drawing a maximum of 
          1 mA of supply current. The INA219 operates from –40°C to 125°C.
          </p>
