      <p> This is me. I always forget to smile for pictures, but oh well </p> 
      </div>
      <div class="a4" class="container"> <p> My name is Vutivi Mabasa, I am a 4th year B.Eng. Electrical and Electronics 
      engineering student at UJ, and a UJENIUS club member, which I am told means I am one of the top performing students at 
      the university. I used to work as a Heat Treatment technician at Stanley Black & Decker, but I quit to pursue my lifelong
      dream of being an electrical engineer. I fully subscribe to the mantra that hard work beats talent every time. I am far 
      from being the smartest guy around, but I (over)compensate for this through sheer hard work and determination. My work 
      ethic is guided by these two words, order, and consistency. I break down and plan all my tasks, and then work consistently 
      everyday towards each of them; I never leave anything to chance. That is how I handle the pressures of varsity - through
      the power of the schedule. I never miss deadlines, I never give excuses, and I always try to maintain very high 
      standards in my work. I love learning, always curious, and I ask lots of questions. Welcome to my website, hope you find 
      it interesting.

      <p> This is what I wear when I am trying to pretend to look professional </p> 
      </div>      
      <div class="a4" class="container"> <p> Originally from a small town in Limpopo, I currently reside in Devland, 
      Johannesburg. I would describe myself as a high-performing individual, a nonconformist who believes that the only limits 
      one has are those he sets for himself. I chose to do a research project in reweable energy because I am committed to the 
      fight against the devastating impacts of climate change on our planet. As of 2020, the Doomsday clock reads 100 seconds 
      to midnight. We cannot continue leaving it up to the governments and companies. It is up to us, now. We, the citizens of 
      this beautiful planet must take it upon ourselves to ensure its continued survival; because if we don't, we will wake up 
      one day and it will be too late; and those that helped destroy this place while we sat back and watched? Well, they'll 
      be on their way to Mars! Don't forget to check out my social media accounts, especially my YouTube channel where I post
      about my favourite topic in all of physics, electromagnetic theory. I do think Maxwell is the greatest of all time, by the way.

      <div class="a4" class="container"> <h3> Some of my achievemets as a student: </h3> <p> As one of the top-achieving 
      students at UJ, I am frequently invited to the Dean's honors award ceremonies due to my academic achievements. 
      I am a very hard-working person and I love what I do, which I believe is a critical ingredient for success in anything, 
      really. I do not shy away from responsibility because I have a strong belief in myself and my abilities, and that is 
      why I often volunteer to be a group leader or captain whenever group work is involved. I take practice makes perfect 
      to extreme levels. I do not stop until I have mastered something, and I'm not afraid to go after what I want. On a 
      lighter note, my favourite hobby is reading, especially fiction like Stephen King and Graham Masterton.  </p>  </div>
